Hi, me from the future. It's great to have made this, wasnt it.


I hope life is well, and I hope you're creating the very things I dream of.
Right now I'm loving learning all this cool shit! learning how to use the terminal,
learning about vim and cmake, and soon hoping to learn about OpenGL. Yea, I'm doing
that so YOU can be better off. So please don't screw this up. I love you <3
